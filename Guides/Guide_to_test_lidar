# Guide to test Lidar

#### Note - Clone this repo and copy the lidar-test folder onto your laptop workspace and connect the lidar to your laptop

### Check if you can detect ttyUSB0 (This is what lidar is mostly connected to)
```ls /dev/tty*```


### Giving permisions for lidar to use serial communication through that port
```sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0```

### Navigate into the copied folder lidar-test
```cd $path/lidar-test```

### Build the package
```colcon build```

###Source the build
```source install/setup.bash```

###Run the launch file to check in Rviz
```ros2 launch rplidar_ros view_rplidar_a2m12_launch.py```
